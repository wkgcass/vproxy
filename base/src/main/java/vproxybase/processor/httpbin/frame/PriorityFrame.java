/*
 * HTTP2:
 *
 * 6.3.  PRIORITY
 *
 *    The PRIORITY frame (type=0x2) specifies the sender-advised priority
 *    of a stream (Section 5.3).  It can be sent in any stream state,
 *    including idle or closed streams.
 *
 *     +-+-------------------------------------------------------------+
 *     |E|                  Stream Dependency (31)                     |
 *     +-+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
 *     |   Weight (8)  |
 *     +-+-------------+
 *
 *                      Figure 8: PRIORITY Frame Payload
 *
 *    The payload of a PRIORITY frame contains the following fields:
 *
 *    E: A single-bit flag indicating that the stream dependency is
 *       exclusive (see Section 5.3).
 *
 *    Stream Dependency:  A 31-bit stream identifier for the stream that
 *       this stream depends on (see Section 5.3).
 *
 *    Weight:  An unsigned 8-bit integer representing a priority weight for
 *       the stream (see Section 5.3).  Add one to the value to obtain a
 *       weight between 1 and 256.
 *
 *    The PRIORITY frame does not define any flags.
 *
 *    The PRIORITY frame always identifies a stream.  If a PRIORITY frame
 *    is received with a stream identifier of 0x0, the recipient MUST
 *    respond with a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type
 *    PROTOCOL_ERROR.
 *
 *    The PRIORITY frame can be sent on a stream in any state, though it
 *    cannot be sent between consecutive frames that comprise a single
 *    header block (Section 4.3).  Note that this frame could arrive after
 *    processing or frame sending has completed, which would cause it to
 *    have no effect on the identified stream.  For a stream that is in the
 *    "half-closed (remote)" or "closed" state, this frame can only affect
 *    processing of the identified stream and its dependent streams; it
 *    does not affect frame transmission on that stream.
 *
 *    The PRIORITY frame can be sent for a stream in the "idle" or "closed"
 *    state.  This allows for the reprioritization of a group of dependent
 *    streams by altering the priority of an unused or closed parent
 *    stream.
 *
 *    A PRIORITY frame with a length other than 5 octets MUST be treated as
 *    a stream error (Section 5.4.2) of type FRAME_SIZE_ERROR.
