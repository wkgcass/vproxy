# ABOUT SYMBOLS:
#
# Symbols can be attached to `proxy.server.list.start` or `proxy.domain.list.start`.
# If not attached with any symbol, the symbol will be set to "DEFAULT".
#
# When a request arrives, the agent will check for domain in all domain lists
# (however, the order is an undefined behavior, except that DEFAULT list is always checked last).
# If any rule matches, the agent will retrieve the symbol of the list which contains the matched rule.
# Then the agent will get the SERVER list with the SAME symbol attached,
# and will get a healthy server from the server list to handle the proxy.
#

#
# The list of proxy server address
# use websocks:// for tcp connections
# use websockss:// for tls connections
# use websocks:kcp:// for unencrypted kcp connections
# use websockss:kcp:// for tls encrypted kcp connections
#
# This `proxy.server.list.start` example statement is not followed by any symbol,
# which will automatically append a `DEFAULT` symbol by the agent.
#
# NOTE: port should ALWAYS be specified, even if it's 80 or 443
#
# After the address, you may specify a tunnel program.
# There are some placeholders:
# * ~: the user.home directory
# * $SERVER_IP: the remote server ip
# * $SERVER_PORT: the remote server port
# * $LOCAL_PORT: the local listening port (randomly chosen by the program)
